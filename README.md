### Story Board
The Battle of Takodana was a battle that took place during the early stages of the war between the forces of the First Order and the Resistance on the Mid Rim planet Takodana. During this battle, Maz Kanata's castle was attacked by Kylo Ren and his First Order stormtroopers in an attempt to capture the droid BB-8, believed to hold valuable intel. Along with the army of stormtroopers, aerial support in the form of TIE/fo space superiority fighters obliterated the castle, forcing the resistance to disperse, flee or fight in order to survive. BB-8 escapes into the forests surrounding the castle along with Rey, until they are spotted and Kylo Ren is alerted to their position. Ren deploys stormtroopers to search for them, soon following himself. As the battle begins to look dire and with the First Order poised to claim victory, Commander Poe Dameran swoops into the action with a legion of Resistance T-70 X-Wing starfighters. A fierce dogfight ensues and results in the destruction of many First Order TIEs and the stormtrooper forces on the ground being toppled. Despite the Resistance emerging victorious, Rey is captured by the enemy.

Scenes:
- Scene 1: The camera follows a formation of TIE-fighters headed by Kylo Ren as they fly over the castle.
- Scene 2: The camera sweeps across the castle, with fighters swarming in the background firing at the ground.
- Scene 3: The legion of X-Wings, led by Commander Dameron close in on the battleground, voice comms can be heard from Poe Dameron.
- Scene 4: The X-Wings diverge and co-ordinate their attack on the TIE-fighters, using composite steering behaviours to simultaneously follow Commander Dameron, target and shoot the enemy.
- Scene 5: The X-Wings destroy the TIE-fighters and converge back into formation, communicating a triumph over the First Order.

Each scene as of now covers a basic storytelling idea, and is planned to be expanded throughout development.
